          <h2>What is Beatmap?</h2>
          <p>Beatmap is my answer to the overwhelming number of music and music services that are out there. I wanted something that helps you find good music, and gives you the freedom to listen using what you want. This is a work in progress on that idea.</p>
          <h2>How does it work?</h2>
          <p>All Beatmap needs is an artist that you like, and it will give you a huge list of new albums to listen to. First, it uses <a href="http://last.fm" target="_blank">Last.fm</a> to get artist recommendations based on its massive amount of user listening history. Then it starts grabbing albums and looks them up for you on <a href="http://spotify.com" target="_blank">Spotify</a> and <a href="http://youtube.com" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. Finally, it lets you listen, make playlists, and get information on these albums and artists.</p>
          <h2>What's next?</h2>
          <p>I am constantly working to improve and expand Beatmap. I am planning on integrating more popular music services, such as <a href="http://streamus.com" target="_blank">Streamus</a>, <a href="http://play.google.com" target="_blank">Google Play Music</a>, and <a href="http://pandora.com" target="_blank">Pandora</a>. Also planned is for users to be able like and dislike albums, make and share playlists, and more. In the works is <a href="https://github.com/epleaner/scrape-your-music" target="_blank">a scraping tool</a> for <a href="http://rateyourmusic.com" target="_blank">RateYourMusic</a>, which would provide more information on albums and their popularity. In the future, I plan to implement my own recommendation algorithm that would combine information from multiple services to provide even more accurate results.</p>
          <p>If you like this project and have ideas to improve it, please let me know!</p><p>- Eli Pleaner</p>
